# Planning Customizations

You may not need a full formal specification for your pluginsâ€”but
if you don't know where you're going, how will you know when you get there?

There are several ways to plan your customizations:

* a spreadsheet, specifying each attribute
* mockup documents
* a specification, listing attributes and required values

If the team creating the specifications is not familiar
with either CSS or XSL:FO, take the data with a grain of salt.
You may find that you need to interpret the specifications
in a way that works best for both the DITA-OT and your team's intent.

At the very least, specify:

* page size (for PDF)
* margins (for PDF)
* fonts
* headers and footers

One technique that makes customization easier: minimalism.
Make the minimum changes that produce acceptable output.
The result is easier to maintain, and easier to debug.
