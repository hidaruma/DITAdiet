# Introducing Lightweight DITA

This chapter explains the rationale behind Lightweight DITA (LwDITA).
If you prefer to jump right in, proceed to [Getting Started](getstart.md).

Structured, topic-based authoring has many benefits.
But it often comes with complexity and cost that put it beyond the reach
of many documentation departments.

DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) is the current gold standard
for structured documentation.
Its flexible "specialization" mechanism
gives it the ability to adapt to the needs of most documentation groups.
Still, DITA has a reputation—at least partially earned—for
being overly complex and expensive to implement.
Even the DITA Technical Committee (TC) admits the full-DITA standard
has become highly complex:

> Conference presentations and practitioners' blogs
occasionally describe DITA as an intimidating grammar
with too many document and element types.
In the base edition, DITA 1.3 has three document types and 189 element types.
In contrast, LwDITA has two document types and 48 element types.
39 of the element types are defined in DITA 1.3,
and the other 9 are multimedia element types
that are part of a forthcoming domain intended for use with DITA 1.3.

Fortunately, DITA—and XML in general—is not an absolute requirement for structured,
topic-based authoring.
Indeed, the [Bell System Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System_Practices)
were topic-based and predate computers, let alone XML.
