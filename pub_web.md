# Publishing Web Output

The DITA-OT supports several HTML variants.

To publish your LwDITA book to HTML, use the following command:

    dita --input=yourbook.map --format=[type]

The *type* is one of the following:

* `xhtml`
* `html5`
* `htmlhelp`
* `tocjs` (XHTML with a Javascript-based table of contents)
* `eclipsehelp` (XHTML with Eclipse Help control files)
