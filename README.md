# DITA on a Diet: Setting Up and Using Lightweight DITA (LwDITA)

Topic-based, structured authoring has well-known benefits,
but traditionally require high-end XML-based publishing systems.
The costs to acquire and support those systems
place them out of reach for many documentation departments.

Lightweight DITA (LwDITA) is changing that.
Write your topics in HTML5 or Markdown,
and use the standard [DITA Open Toolkit](http://dita-ot.org/)
to publish.
Markdown and HTML5 topics are co-equal with full-weight DITA topics,
allowing SMEs to contribute content in familiar formats
for departments with a DITA-based publishing system.

In this small 68-page (PDF) book,
Larry Kollar shows you how to set up and deploy
an LwDITA publsihing system using open-source tools.
