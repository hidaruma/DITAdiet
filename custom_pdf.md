# Customizing PDF Output

The bad news is, the default DITA-OT PDF plugin is incredibly complex, and…
let us say, the output leaves somewhat to be desired.
The good news is, it provides an excellent framework for customizations.
You can make basic changes
without much knowledge of XSLT or XSL:FO.
With some knowledge of each,
you can tailor the output exactly as needed.

Teaching XSLT and XSL:FO is far beyond the scope of this manual.
To get started, try these links:

* [XSLT](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_intro.asp)
* [Xpath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp)
* [XSL:FO](http://w3schools.sinsixx.com/xslfo/default.asp.htm)

We provide two examples:

* [Simple PDF plugin](custom_pdf_simple.md)—a very basic plugin,
changing only DITA-OT properties and the page size.
* [Extended PDF plugin](custom_pdf_extend.md)—an extension of the simple plugin,
changing a few attributes and the page headers.
