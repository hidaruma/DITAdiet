# Colophon

In keeping with a book about LwDITA, the source is completely MDITA.
Editors used included Atom, Brackets, and Byword (the latter on an iPad).

Publishing used DITA-OT 3.1, which is (in my opinion) the first version
capable of working with LwDITA out of the box.
PDF uses a custom, in-house plugin (which can be found
[on Github](https://github.com/larrykollar/com.ojemedia.pdf69))
and HTML uses a custom CSS (included in the source distribution)
with several property specifications.

Typefaces (PDF): Noto Serif for body and headings,
Anka/Coder Narrow for listings and other monospace usage.
