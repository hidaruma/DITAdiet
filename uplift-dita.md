# Uplifting to Full DITA

You can convert MDITA and HDITA topics to full DITA.
Reasons for conversion include:

* Complex documentation requires more complexity than Markdown supports.
* You need to interchange DITA topics with other groups.
* Your documentation needs to conform to some industry standard.
* The group is large enough to justify a Component CMS (CCMS).
